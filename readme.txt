= The Only Platform Build From The Ground Up For WordPress Community Hosting =

We only have one goal; Providing a turn-key solution for those who manage a community powered by WordPress. We call WeFoster a "WordPress Community Platform" because it's so much more then just hosting. Yes, our entire infastructure is 110% optimised for WordPress communities but we also add security, maintenance, expert support, and a WordPress Community Builders HUB to the mix!

Most community owners are not technically minded or even interested in managing a traditional web hosting setup. This is why we strive to provide the best tools and services to help foster and grow custom online communities powered by WordPress.

We've also seen many great community ideas never take off because of their owners getting lost during the way. Our thriving community of site owners and developers all share a common goal: Building Better Communities with WordPress. We’re here to make your community a success and that goes far beyond just hosting.
